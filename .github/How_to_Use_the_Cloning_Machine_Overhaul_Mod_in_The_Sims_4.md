To install this mod, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the mod from [GitHub](https://github.com/MAL22/Sims4-CloningMachineOverhaul/) or [Sims 4 Updates](https://sims4updates.net/mods/cloning-machine-overhaul-by-mal22-at-mod-the-sims/).
2. Extract the zip file and copy both the package file and the ts4script file into your Mods folder. The Mods folder is located in Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods.
3. Make sure you have enabled script mods in your game settings. To do this, go to Game Options > Other and check the box that says "Enable Custom Content and Mods" and "Script Mods Allowed". Then restart your game.

## How to Use the Cloning Machine Overhaul Mod
 
Once you have installed the mod, you can use it in your game by following these steps:

1. Acquire a cloning machine. You can do this by either joining the scientist career and reaching level 6, or by using cheats. To use cheats, press Ctrl + Shift + C to open the cheat console, type "testingcheats true" and press Enter, then type "bb.showhiddenobjects" and press Enter. Then go to Build Mode and search for "cloning machine" in the search bar. You can place it on any lot.
2. Interact with the cloning machine. You can clone different objects or sims by using different interactions. For example, you can clone an object by dragging it into the cloning machine inventory and clicking on "Clone Object". You can clone a sim by clicking on "Clone Sim" and selecting a sim from a list of nearby sims or from your household. You can also clone a sim using a DNA sample by clicking on "Clone Sim Using DNA Sample" and selecting a DNA sample from your inventory. You can obtain DNA samples by using the "Collect DNA Sample" interaction on other sims.
3. Choose your cloning options. After selecting what or who you want to clone, you will be presented with four cloning options: Age, Sex, Gender, and Family Tie. You can choose any combination of these options to customize your clone. For example, you can create a child clone of yourself with a feminine body and male gender who is regarded as your sibling. The possibilities are endless!
4. Enjoy your clone. After choosing your cloning options, you will see a short animation of the cloning process and then your clone will appear next to the cloning machine. Your clone will have the same traits, skills, relationships, and appearance as the original sim, except for the options you changed. You can interact with your clone as you would with any other sim.

## Conclusion
 
The Cloning Machine Overhaul mod is a fun and creative way to add some sci-fi flavor to your Sims 4 gameplay. You can create clones of yourself or other sims with different options and features, and experiment with different scenarios and outcomes. If you are looking for a new challenge or just want to have some fun, give this mod a try!
