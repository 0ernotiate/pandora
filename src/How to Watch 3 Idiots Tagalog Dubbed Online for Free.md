3 Idiots is not only a fun and inspiring movie, but also a critique of the Indian education system and society. The film exposes the flaws of rote learning, academic pressure, parental expectations, and social conformity that stifle creativity and individuality. It also celebrates the values of friendship, passion, innovation, and courage that can make a difference in the world.
 
The film is based on the novel Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat, but it also deviates from it in many aspects. The film has been praised for its witty dialogues, catchy songs, and memorable scenes that have become iconic in Indian pop culture. Some of the highlights include the speech by Chatur (Omi Vaidya), the delivery scene with Pia (Kareena Kapoor), and the final reveal of Rancho's identity.
 
The film also features some of the finest performances by its cast, especially Aamir Khan, who convincingly portrays a character much younger than his actual age. Khan also underwent a physical transformation for the role, losing weight and sporting a new hairstyle. The chemistry between Khan, Madhavan, and Joshi is palpable and heartwarming, as they portray the bond of three friends who stand by each other through thick and thin.
