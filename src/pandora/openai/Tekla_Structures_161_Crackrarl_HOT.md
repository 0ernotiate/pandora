One of the new features of the Drawing Log is that it can now work seamlessly with Tekla Structures, a powerful 3D modeling software for structural design and fabrication. When you use the Tekla EPM plugin to import your drawings from Tekla Structures, the Drawing Log will automatically classify them into different types, such as assembly drawings that show how parts are connected, and part drawings that show the dimensions and details of each part. You can also use the settings in Tekla EPM Go, a mobile app for project management and collaboration, to control which Drawing Logs are accessible to your mobile users, such as workers on the shop floor or on the construction site. This development helps you achieve a completely paperless process that saves time, money and resources.

The Drawing Log is a powerful tool that helps you manage your drawings throughout the project lifecycle. You can use it to track the status of your drawings, such as approved, revised, issued or received. You can also use it to assign tasks to your team members, such as review, approve or print. The Drawing Log helps you keep track of the changes and revisions in your drawings, and ensures that everyone is working with the latest version.
  
The Tekla EPM plugin is a software extension that connects Tekla Structures and Tekla EPM, a comprehensive solution for steel fabrication management. The plugin allows you to import your drawings from Tekla Structures to Tekla EPM, where you can use the Drawing Log to manage them. The plugin also allows you to export your production data from Tekla EPM to Tekla Structures, where you can use it to update your 3D model and drawings. The plugin enables a smooth data flow between the two software platforms, and improves the accuracy and efficiency of your fabrication process.
